    "# shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() are functions provided by the shutil module in Python for copying files and directories, \n",
    "#  respectively. Here are the key differences between these two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a) Purpose:\n",
    "# i) shutil.copy(): Used to copy a single file from one location to another.\n",
    "# ii) shutil.copytree(): Used to copy an entire directory and its contents (including subdirectories and files) from one\n",
    "#     location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b) Parameters:\n",
    "# i) shutil.copy(src, dst): Takes two arguments - src (source file path) and dst (destination file path). \n",
    "# ii) shutil.copytree(src, dst): Also takes two arguments - src (source directory path) and dst (destination directory path).\n",
    "    \n",
    "# c) Handling Existing Files/Directories:\n",
    "# i) shutil.copy(): If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "# ii) shutil.copytree(): If the destination directory already exists, a FileExistsError will be raised. \n",
    "    \n",
    "# d)Recursion:\n",
    "# i) shutil.copy(): Operates on a single file and does not handle directories or subdirectories.\n",
    "# ii) shutil.copytree(): Recursively copies all files and subdirectories within the source directory to the destination directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# e)Usage:\n",
    "# i) shutil.copy(): Use when you need to copy individual files.\n",
    "# ii) shutil.copytree(): Use when you need to copy entire directory structures with all their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# f)Return Value:\n",
    "# Both functions return the path to the copied file or directory."
